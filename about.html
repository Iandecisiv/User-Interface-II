		<h1>About me</h1>
		<p>I am a cool guy that enjoys lots of cool things like animals, adventure, coding, and the like.  All the cool kids enjoy cool things because they are cool people who are cool.  And I'm cool so I enjoy cool things too! I am not a squirrel because squirrels are cute and not cool.  But if I was a squirrel I would be a cool squirel.  Also sunglasses, because sunglasses are cool.</p>
